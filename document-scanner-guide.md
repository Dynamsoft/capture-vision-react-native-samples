# Document Scanner Integration Guide

In this guide, we will explore the Document Scanner features of the [Dynamsoft Capture Vision](https://www.dynamsoft.com/capture-vision/docs/core/introduction/) SDK.

## System Requirements

### React Native

- Supported Version: 0.71.0 or higher

### Android

- Supported OS: Android 5.0 (API Level 21) or higher.
- Supported ABI: armeabi-v7a, arm64-v8a, x86 and x86_64.
- Development Environment: Android Studio 2022.2.1 or higher.

### iOS

- Supported OS: iOS 11+ (iOS 13+ recommended).
- Supported ABI: arm64 and x86_64.
- Development Environment: Xcode 13+ (Xcode 14.1+ recommended).

### Others

- Node: 18 or higher

## Installation

Run the following commands in the root directory of your react-native project to add `dynamsoft-capture-vision-react-native` into dependencies

```bash
# using npm
npm install dynamsoft-capture-vision-react-native

# OR using Yarn
yarn add dynamsoft-capture-vision-react-native
```

then run the command to install all dependencies:

```bash
# using npm
npm install 

# OR using Yarn
yarn install
```

For iOS, you must install the necessary native frameworks from CocoaPods by running the pod install command as below:

```bash
cd ios
pod install
```

## Configure Native Projects

The Dynamsoft Capture Vision SDK needs the camera permission to use the camera device, so it can capture from video stream.

### Android

For Android, we have defined camera permission within the SDK, you don't need to do anything.

### iOS

For iOS, you need to include the camera permission in `ios/your-project-name/Info.plist` inside the `<dict>` element:
```
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
    <string></string>
```

## Build the Document Scanner Component

Now that the package is added, it's time to start building the document scanner component using the SDK.

### Initialize License

The first step in code configuration is to initialize a valid license via `LicenseManager.initLicense`.

```typescript jsx
import {LicenseManager} from 'dynamsoft-capture-vision-react-native';

LicenseManager.initLicense("your-license-key")
.then(()=>{/*Init license successfully.*/})
.catch(error => console.error("Init License failed.", error));
```

> [!NOTE]
>
>- The license string here grants a time-limited free trial which requires network connection to work.
>- You can request a 30-day trial license via the [Request a Trial License](https://www.dynamsoft.com/customer/license/trialLicense?product=dcv&utm_source=guide&package=mobile) link.

## Request Camera Permission

Before opening camera to start document scanning, you need to request camera permission from system.

```typescript jsx
import {CameraEnhancer} from 'dynamsoft-capture-vision-react-native';

CameraEnhancer.requestCameraPermission();
```

## Implement Document Scanning from Video Stream

The basic workflow of scanning a document from video stream is as follows:

- Initialize the `CameraEnhancer` object
- Initialize the `CaptureVisionRouter` object
- Bind the `CameraEnhancer` object to the `CaptureVisionRouter` object
- Register a `CapturedResultReceiver` object to listen for scanned document via the callback function `onNormalizedImagesReceived`
- Open the camera
- Start document scanning via `startCapturing`

```typescript jsx
import React, {useEffect, useRef, useState} from 'react';
import {
  CameraEnhancer,
  CameraView,
  RecognizedTextLinesResult,
  CaptureVisionRouter,
  EnumPresetTemplate,
  ParsedResult, DetectedQuadsResult, NormalizedImagesResult, imageDataToBase64
} from 'dynamsoft-capture-vision-react-native';

export function Scanner() {
  const cameraView = useRef<CameraView>(null); // Create a reference to the CameraView component using useRef.
  const camera = CameraEnhancer.getInstance(); //Get the singleton instance of CameraEnhancer
  const router = CaptureVisionRouter.getInstance(); //Get the singleton instance of CaptureVisionRouter

  useEffect(() => {
    router.setInput(camera); //Bind the CaptureVisionRouter and ImageSourceAdapter before router.startCapturing()
    camera.setCameraView(cameraView.current!!); //Bind the CameraEnhancer and CameraView before camera.open()

    /**
     * Adds a CapturedResultReceiver object to listen the captured result.
     * In this sample, we only listen onDetectedQuadsReceived or onNormalizedImagesReceived generated by Dynamsoft Document Normalizer module.
     * */
    let resultReceiver = router.addResultReceiver({

      //If start capturing with EnumPresetTemplate.PT_DETECT_AND_NORMALIZE_DOCUMENT, 
      //NormalizedImagesResult will be received on this callback.
      onNormalizedImagesReceived: (result: NormalizedImagesResult) => {
        //Handle the `result`. 
        if (result.items && result.items.length > 0) {
          let normalizeImageBase64 = imageDataToBase64(result.items[0].imageData)
          //...
        }
      },
    });

    /**
     * Open the camera when the component is mounted.
     * Please remember to request camera permission before it.
     * */
    camera.open();

    /**
     * Start capturing when the component is mounted.
     * In this sample codes, we start capturing by using EnumPresetTemplate.PT_DETECT_AND_NORMALIZE_DOCUMENT template.
     * */
    router.startCapturing(EnumPresetTemplate.PT_DETECT_AND_NORMALIZE_DOCUMENT);

    return () => {
      //Remove the receiver when the component is unmounted.
      router.removeResultReceiver(resultReceiver);

      //Close the camera when the component is unmounted.
      camera.close();

      //Stop capturing when the component is unmounted.
      router.stopCapturing();
    }
  }, [camera, router, cameraView]);

  return (
    <CameraView style={{flex: 1}} ref={cameraView}>
      {/* you can add your own view here as the children view of CameraView */}
    </CameraView>
  );
}
```

## Customize the Document Scanner

If you want to detect document boundary and adjust the boundary manually, you can `startCapturing` with `EnumPresetTemplate.PT_DETECT_DOCUMENT_BOUNDARIES` template. The `DetectedQuadsResult` will then be received through the `onDetectedQuadsReceived` callback. You can use the [Editor component](./DetectAndDeskewDocument/src/Editor.tsx) to learn how to draw `DetectQuadResult` on the original image and interactively edit the quads.

The full sample code is available [here](./DetectAndDeskewDocument).

## Run the Project

Go to your project folder, open a _new_ terminal and run the following command:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

#### Signing

- Open the **workspace** file `*.xcworkspace` (not .xcodeproj) from the `ios` directory in Xcode.
- Adjust *Provisioning* and *Signing* settings.

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running on your device.
This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to run Android via `Windows`, You may encounter some build errors due to the `Windows Maximum Path Length Limitation`.
> Therefore, we recommend that you move the project to a directory with a shorter path.
